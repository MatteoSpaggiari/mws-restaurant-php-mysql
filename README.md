# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course
---
#### Completed course (thanks a lot to Udacity and Google)

## Project Overview

The project consisted of creating a web application (mobile-ready) for reviewing restaurants.
IMPORTANT: The application is able to work offline (thanks to the Service Worker, IndexedDB and Cache Storage).


### Specification

The application has been modified, compared to that of the Udacity Mobile Web Specialist course, adding PHP code and a MySQL database.
The server written in PHP and the .db file (MySQL DataBase) can be found at this link: https://github.com/MatteoSpaggiari/server-php-mws-restaurant
An online version can be found at this address: https://www.matteospaggiari.it/progetti/mws-restaurant-project-udacity/
